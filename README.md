Instructions for running:
1. Needs java >= 11 &

3. Run ```<Linux || mac>$ chmod +x mvnw``` to make it runnable

I really have no skills in frontend-dev, nor am I very interested, but got to learn a little bit of Vue.js <3

Could have used SpringBoot reactive WebClient, but that's for another exercise.
